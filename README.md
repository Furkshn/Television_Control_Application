<h1 align="center">:movie_camera: Television Control Application :tv: </h1>

- It is a television control application that I have created using object oriented programming logic and where operations such as opening an application, adding channels or turning on TV sound are performed.

- Transactions that can be done in the television control application:

    <ul>
        <li>Turn on the television</li>
        <li>Turn off the TV.</li>
        <li>Sound settings.</li>
        <li>Adding a channel.</li>
        <li>Random channel option</li>
        <li>Opening applications such as Netflix, Youtube.</li>
    </ul>
